            There are an unknown number of smaller dwarf planets and innumerable
            small Solar System bodies orbiting the Sun. Six of the major
            planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of the
            smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, commonly called
            "moons" after Earth's Moon. Two natural satellites, Jupiter's moon
            Ganymede and Saturn's moon Titan, are larger but not more massive
            than Mercury, the smallest terrestrial planet, and Jupiter's moon
            Callisto is nearly as large. Each of the giant planets and some
            smaller bodies are encircled by planetary rings of ice, dust and
            moonlets. The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars
            and Jupiter, contains objects composed of rock, metal and ice.
            Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which
            are populations of objects composed mostly of ice and rock.

            In the outer reaches of the Solar System lies a class of minor
            planets called detached objects. There is considerable debate as to
            how many such objects there will prove to be. Some of these objects
            are large enough to have rounded under their own gravity and thus to
            be categorized as dwarf planets. Astronomers generally accept about
            nine objects as dwarf planets: the asteroid Ceres, the Kuiper-belt
            objects Pluto, Orcus, Haumea, Quaoar and Makemake, the
            scattered-disk objects Gonggong and Eris, and Sedna. Various
            small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and
            interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between the regions of the
            Solar System.

            The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from
            the Sun, creates a bubble-like region of interplanetary medium in
            the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is
            the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the
            opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out to the
            edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be
            the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance
            roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar
            System is located 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky
            Way galaxy in the Orion Arm, which contains most of the visible
            stars in the night sky. The nearest stars are within the so-called
            Local Bubble, with the closest, Proxima Centauri, at 4.2441
            light-years.
